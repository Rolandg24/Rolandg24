Dedicated IT Technician with a strong background in project management, audio engineering, and junior software development. My journey from the music industry to the tech industry has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise, creativity, and leadership.

For four years, I led an audio department, helping to successfully expand a radio program from 3 stations to over 200 nationwide, reaching over 800,000 listeners monthly. My decade of experience in music production, along with a contracted role as a High School Percussion Educator, highlighted the critical need for technological innovations in the education and music industries. This realization inspired my transition into IT, where I now blend hands-on technical skills with software development capabilities and hardware support to make a meaningful impact.

Iâ€™m eager to leverage my skills as a versatile IT Technician and Junior Developer to create innovative solutions across multiple industries.
